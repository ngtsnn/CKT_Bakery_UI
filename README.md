This UI is used for coding PHP by my team. If you think it's awesome, feel free to take this with no license. I hope this UI is helpful for you !!!

Explaination: 
- Just clone it and find the folder "page". Double click which page you want to see and it contain index.html. You can edit it to make your own page.
  + Be carefull when edit the link to css or js. Just rearrange some link to css or js and something will not working.
- In folder "asset", I include some open sources, reset.css and setup.css.
  + You can add more open source in asset folder but don't forget link in your html file after my link.
  + The reset.css I take from https://960.gs/
  + The setup.css I make some color, gaps, margin, padding and so on.
- In folder "components" which contains components I have already defined. You can add more or reuse.
  + In each component, it contains css, js files and sample html code. Copy the sample code and paste in your html file BUT follows my structure page folder and it works.
